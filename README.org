 This scatterplot is constructed from a TSV file storing the dimensions
 of sepals and petals of various iris flowers. The chart employs
 conventional margins and a number of D3 features:

    d3.tsv - load and parse data
    d3.scale.linear - x- and y-position encoding
    d3.scale.ordinal - color encoding
    d3.extent - compute domains
    d3.svg.axis - display axes
