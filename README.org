 EF-MVP-IP - Efficient Frontier / Minimum Variance Portfoilio Interactive Plot
==============================================================================
2013-2020 Mike Kleyn

mvp/lib    javascript
mvp/3lib   third party javascript kept copied here for convenience
mvp/html   the web page and json data read-in by the web page
mvp/logs   sample console log
mvp/nb     Jupyter/sympy notebook (orignally SageMath/Cocalc)

* To Run

1) start webserver in folder mvp/

  e.g python3:  python -m http.server 2345


2) Open page html/mvpPlotFramed.html

 it accesses json data file in same html folder
 and JS code  in:
    lib/mvp.js
    3lib/d3.v3.js         or d3.v3.min.js
    3lib/numeric-1.2.6.js or numeric-1.2.6.min.js


* Comments

This repo uses several languages each of which 
has its own conventions and idiosyncracies 
in doing matrix/numeric calculations:

   python       - e.g. @ is the preferred matrix multiply operator
   sympy        - e.g. * is the preferred matrix multiply operator
   javascript/
     numeric.js - e.g. nested arrays are used row-major: [1,2,3] is a row vector, 
                                                         [[1],[2],[3]] is a column vector.

The referenced paper (Beste, Leventhal, Williams, & Dr. Qin Lu "Markowitz Review Paper" 
 http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/tumath/research/studpapers/s21.pdf 
tends to use vectors of ones to express summations

The sympy notebook was translated from the original version done in the very nice SageMath=Cocalc.


* TBD

** could use an sector of a circle to indicate correlation?
semi-circle        => correl = -1.0
right angle sector => correl =  0.0 
epsilon segment    => correl =  0.999999

var arcGenerator = d3.arc();
 It can then be passed an object containing startAngle, endAngle, innerRadius and outerRadius properties to produce the path data:

var pathData = arcGenerator({
  startAngle: 0,
  endAngle: 0.25 * Math.PI,
  innerRadius: 50,
  outerRadius: 100
});

** exact hyperbola via NURBS:

* Derived From/Acknowledgements

** Mike Bostock â€™s (mbostock) block #3887118 Scatterplot June 9, 2013
 Open in a new window.
  This scatterplot is constructed from a TSV file storing the dimensions
  of sepals and petals of various iris flowers. The chart employs
  conventional margins and a number of D3 features:
    d3.tsv - load and parse data
    d3.scale.linear - x- and y-position encoding
    d3.scale.ordinal - color encoding
    d3.extent - compute domains
    d3.svg.axis - display axes
** numeric.js
there may be better ones since this 2014 vintage js library


* Log Notes:
20200423_18:17:57 changed precision in numeric.js, but TBD in numeric.min.js
20200423_18:17:31 tidy before upload
20200414_12:33:20 more features working: correlation lines, hyperbola
20200113_22:46:28 revived for move to git
20171029_00:26:59 renamed to mvpVary
20171029_00:02:56 latest version was in home/kleyn/Emp/tw20/projects/svnw/reactiveRrBubbleChart
20171029_00:02:54 Used to be called reactiveRrBubbleChart
20150102_12:33:01 Flesh out basic idea
20130726_17:45:22 Basic Idea
