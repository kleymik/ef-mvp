    <h2> MVP Plot Description</h2>
    <p> This plot shows a minimum variance portfolio.
      The <i>area</i> (not the diameter) of each circle represents the weight the given asset in the portfolio.
      The Total Portfolio (100% weight) in shown in red.
      Drag on the circle to increase or decrease its size and hence the weight of that asset in the Portfolio.
      As the dragged asset's weight is decreased (increased), all other assets will have their weights increased (decreased) in equal measure.

<!--
Iframes can best be described as embedded HTML document within another HTML document. They can best be defined as such:

<iframe id="content"></iframe>
In order to get something to show up within the embedded iframe, you have to first get the “contentDocument” of the iframe element you previously defined (reference definition of iframe above).

let doc = document.getElementById("content").contentDocument;
The “contentDocument” is then what you can use to pass to the “select” method of D3.js.

d3.select(doc); 
// continue rest of D3.js code
